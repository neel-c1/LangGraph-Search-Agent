SCOPE_PROMPT = """You are a research scoping assistant.

Your job is to help clarify and structure a user's research question into a brief and focused objective. 
If the user's input is ambiguous, incomplete, or too broad, ask clarifying questions. 
If the input is sufficiently clear, structure it as a research brief.

User input:
"{user_input}"

Respond with either:
- A structured research brief including the overall topic and 2-4 sub-questions.
- Or a list of clarifying questions needed to better define the request.
"""

RESEARCH_PROMPT = """You are a research assistant.

Your goal is to investigate the research brief and its sub-questions using web search results.

Research brief:
{research_brief}

For each sub-question, retrieve relevant information using a search engine, then summarize key facts or findings clearly. Use bullet points where appropriate. Include source snippets and URLs if available.

Return a structured list of sub-questions, each followed by a brief summary of the most relevant information you found.
"""

WRITE_PROMPT = """You are a research synthesis assistant.

You have received structured findings for a user's question.

Your task is to write a detailed, plain-text report of **two or three paragraphs** using the research findings provided below. Expand on the material by explaining implications, context, or significance where relevant.

Write in a clear and engaging style, suitable for a well-informed but non-expert reader. Avoid bullet points, markdown, or technical formatting. Just use natural paragraphs.
