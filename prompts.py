Your job is to help clarify and structure a user's research question into a brief and focused objective. 
If the user's input is ambiguous, incomplete, or too broad, ask clarifying questions. 
If the input is sufficiently clear, structure it as a research brief.

User input:
"{user_input}"

Respond with either:
- A structured research brief including the overall topic and 2â€“4 sub-questions.
- Or a list of clarifying questions needed to better define the request.

Your goal is to investigate the research brief and its sub-questions using web search results.

Research brief:
{research_brief}

For each sub-question, retrieve relevant information using a search engine, then summarize key facts or findings clearly. Use bullet points where appropriate. Include source snippets and URLs if available.

Return a structured list of sub-questions, each followed by a brief summary of the most relevant information you found.
